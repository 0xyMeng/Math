# Introduction to Control System

This chapter provides an introduction to the basic history of control theory and practice. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general approach to designing and building a control system.

We discuss open- and close-loop feedback control systems. 

Control system engineers are concerned with **understanding** and **controlling** segments of their environment, often called systems, to provide useful economic products for society.

The twin goals of understanding and controlling are complementary because effective systems control requires that the systems be understood and modeled.
